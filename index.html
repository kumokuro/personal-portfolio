                     </header>
                     <p>I am a software engineering student at Thinkful. I grew up in Dallas, TX and is currently where I call home.</p>
                     <p>Some goals I have for this year are:</p>
                     <ol>
                         <li>Landing my first job as a full-stack web developer</li>
                         <li>Moving to the west coast (Seattle)</li>
                         <li>Improving my Spanish speaking skills!</li>
                     </ol>

                    </header>
                     <p>In the past year of 2020, I found myself searching for a new skill or hobby to learn from home, and discovered the world of coding.
                         Immediately I fell in love with the beauty of this constantly evolving field where there will always be more to learn,
                         something new to create, and can be incredibly rewarding. 
                     </p>
                     <p>Outside of the programming world, I am a major foodie and love supporting the locally-owned businesses around me.
                         I've spent a few years working in cafes, so I'm also a master at coffee brewing (yes there is a craft to it!). 
                         And I'm on a mission to visit as many National Parks as I can. 
                     </p>
                     <p>I am always welcome to collaborating with others! Please contact me below, and let's talk!</p>
